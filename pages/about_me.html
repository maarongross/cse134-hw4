          <h2>Hi! My name is Matthew Gross!</h2>
          <p>I'm 22 years old, I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and I'm currently attending UC San Diego to study Computer Engineering.<br>
          When I'm not grinding through various CS and EE assignments, I like to practice clarinet, rock climb, listen to music, game, and speedcube.</p>

        <h2>I got started in Computer Engineering because of Minecraft</h2>
        <p>Well, that's <em>mainly</em> due to my friend getting me into building redstone contraptions in the game.</p><br>
          <aside>In case you don't know, redstone is effectively Minecraft's version of a wire, and you can build things ranging from basic circuits to a 16-bit computer.</aside><br>
          <p>This led to me having a great interest in computer hardware specifically, and this interest only grew after investing myself in various courses relating to that subject matter at UC San Diego.</p>
